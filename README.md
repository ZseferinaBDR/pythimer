# Pythimer
This is a dead simple desktop stopwatch application for windows running on Python 3.10 and PyQt6. The puprose of the application is to learn desktop development with python and hopefully providing someone with a good looking tool to use. Note, this repo, codebase and functionality will be changing quite a lot in the comming days.

## Somewhat of a roadmap
- ✅Core functionality for starting and stopping a stopwatch
- ❌ Minimize window, tray icon
- ❌Saving user preferences like window size, screen position and last stopwatch value
- ❌ Ability to add different projects and compile total time for each
- ❌ Overview of time spent on a project

**Note** this is purely an exercice for me and I may stop supporting the application at any given time. That being said, all help, pull requests and rfcs are welcomed.
